## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### For Admins:
1. Use search to quickly find projects
2. Filter by status to focus on urgent items
3. Click stats cards to filter (future feature)
4. Bookmark `/admin/projects` for quick access

### For Developers:
1. Charts use pure CSS + SVG (no libraries needed)
2. Base64 images stored in database
3. Status changes trigger auto-refresh
4. Dark mode uses Tailwind classes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Performance**:
   - Charts render client-side
   - Large projects list (100+) may need pagination
   - Consider lazy loading for images

2. **Storage**:
   - Base64 increases DB size
   - Monitor database growth
   - Consider cleanup policies

3. **Security**:
   - Admin routes protected by role check
   - Project ownership verified
   - Status changes logged (future)
